Rich's solutions for Advent of Code: https://adventofcode.com/2019

Every year, the Advent of Code website shares programming challenges for the first 25 days of December.

For the first couple of weeks, my goal was to find the answers as quickly as possible.  I got stuck a few times (Day 22 was pretty tough for me).
But I plan on finishing them soon-ish so I'll have all stars before December 1st 2020 so I can compete again this year.

All code was written in C#, and I used NUnit for the unit testing framework.
